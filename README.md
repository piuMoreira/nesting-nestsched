# NeSTiNg - NestSched

This repository is an enhancement for NeSTiNg, enabling integration with the Scheduling Generator [TSNsched](https://github.com/ACassimiro/TSNsched#quickstart-guide) and fault injection on TSN devices.

NeSTiNg is a simulation model for Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) using the OMNeT++ discrete event simulation framework.
This model uses the [INET framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org/) and enhances it by TSN-capable components.
The model was initially developed by a group of students during a curricular project and is continously extended at the [Distributed Systems group of IPVS, University of Stuttgart](https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/departments/vs/)
